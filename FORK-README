== About the CT Mission

Thousands of Connecticut residents have difficulty accessing dental care, for the same reasons faced by others in less affluent states. For this reason, the Connecticut Foundation for Dental Outreach (CDFO) in collaboration with the Connecticut State Dental Association (CSDA) embarked upon its first Mission of Mercy project, in April, 2008.

There is no answer for the provision of dental care for adults on the horizon. For this reason alone a MOM project will provide care to those who have no hope of receiving care through our present health care system. The numbers of adults and children are staggering and it is the hope of the Connecticut Dental Association to help those in need of oral health care.
