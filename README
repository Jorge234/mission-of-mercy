== Mission of Mercy Software

Mission of Mercy software was first created to streamline patient intake, x-ray, and check-out processes for the 2009 Connecticut Mission of Mercy dental clinic.

== Changes for 2010

 - Check-In will include several survey question which were previously in check-out
 - Creation of Assignment Desk. Assignment desk will better catalog where patients are flowing and assist in patient allocation
 - Distribution of check-out to treatment areas. This will reduce overall check-out time and increase check-out data integrity.
 - Creation of additional reports for day of and after event

== About the Mission

Thousands of Connecticut residents have difficulty accessing dental care, for the same reasons faced by others in less affluent states. For this reason, the Connecticut Foundation for Dental Outreach (CDFO) in collaboration with the Connecticut State Dental Association (CSDA) embarked upon its first Mission of Mercy project, in April, 2008.

There is no answer for the provision of dental care for adults on the horizon. For this reason alone a MOM project will provide care to those who have no hope of receiving care through our present health care system. The numbers of adults and children are staggering and it is the hope of the Connecticut Dental Association to help those in need of oral health care.
