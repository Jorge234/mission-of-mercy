## What is Mission of Mercy?

While there are other Missions of Mercy around the country, this MoM is a 
gathering of volunteer dental professionals who along with a volunteer staff of 
several hundred hold free, two day dental clinics at locations around the country. 

## Software History

The Mission of Mercy software, or MoM for short, is a web-based software 
solution created for the 2009 Connecticut Mission of Mercy clinic. The project’s 
goal is to streamline patient intake, digital x-ray, and check-out processes during 
the clinic’s operating hours.

In 2010 the software was re-engineered to better track patient flow throughout 
the clinic and to make check-out even faster. By moving several survey questions 
to the registration process and breaking up check-out to each treatment area, 
the CT Mission of Mercy was able to effectively process over 2,000 patients 
(112 chairs) during their two day 2010 clinic.

## License

In 2010 Mission of Mercy software was released under the license of Ruby 1.8 
which made it available to all Mission of Mercy clinics throughout the US.
